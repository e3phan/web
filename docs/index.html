            <h1>Compilers</h1>

            <p>CSE 131 is an introduction to modern Compiler Design.</p>
<p>In this course we will learn how to translate programs written in a high-level language into bare metal – suitable for running on your x86 machine. We will do so by iteratively adding new features to our target language, and making the required additions to the compiler and language runtime to implement them. This course draws on your knowledge from Computer Organization and Programming Langauges.</p>
<h2 id="diversity-and-inclusion">Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
<p>We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and respects your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class, sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.) Our goal is to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable and can thrive.</p>
<p>Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course. If there is a way we can make you feel more included please let one of the course staff know, either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door. Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process, and we welcome your perspectives and input.</p>
<p>We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect your classmates, abiding by the <a href="https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html">UCSD Principles of Community</a>.<br />
Please understand that others’ backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be different than your own, and help us to build an environment where everyone is respected and feels comfortable.</p>
<p>If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, please contact the <a href="https://ophd.ucsd.edu/">Office of Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination.</a></p>
<h2 id="integrity-of-scholarship">Integrity of Scholarship</h2>
<p>University rules on integrity of scholarship will be strictly enforced. By taking this course, you implicitly agree to abide by the UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship described <a href="http://www-senate.ucsd.edu/manual/Appendices/app2.htm">here</a>. In particular,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all academic work will be done by the student to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are expected to do your own work on all assignments; when specified, you <strong>may work in pairs</strong> – but will submit the assignments individually. You may (and are encouraged to) engage in <strong>general discussions</strong> with your classmates regarding the assignments, but specific details of a solution, including the solution itself, <strong>must always be your own work</strong>.</p>
<p>There will be graded assignments and exam in this course, as described below. All exams are closed book; no tools other than your brain and a writing instrument are to be used.</p>
<p>Incidents which violate the University’s rules on integrity of scholarship will be taken seriously. In addition to <strong>receiving a zero (0)</strong> on the assignment/exam in question, students may also face other penalties, up to and including, expulsion from the University. Should you have any doubts about the moral and/or ethical implications of an activity regarding the course, please see the instructor.</p>
<h2 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h2>
<p>The lion’s share of the course material, from assignments to lecture notes, is due to Joe Politz and Ranjit Jhala.</p>
